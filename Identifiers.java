/* Identifiers
 * All Java variables must be identified with unique names.
 * These unique names are called identifiers.
 * Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).
 
 * Note: It is recommended to use descriptive names in order to create understandable and maintainable code:*/
